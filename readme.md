## JavaScript Event Practice

* Fork and clone this repo
* Open `main.js` in your favorite text editor and write JavaScript so that on click:
  * `button one` turns red (toggle CSS class `button-danger`) which means if clicked again it goes back to blue
  * `button two` changes its inner text to `you clicked me`
  * `button three` changes the inner text of `button two` back to "button two"
  * **BONUS:** Accomplish all of the above by binding _only one_ event listener
