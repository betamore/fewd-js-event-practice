## JavaScript Event Practice

* Fork and clone this repo
* Open `main.js` in your favorite text editor and write JavaScript so that on click:
  * `button one` turns red (**toggle** the `button-danger` CSS class) which means if clicked again it goes back to blue
  * `button two` changes its **inner text** to `you clicked me`
  * `button three` changes the **inner text** of `button two` back to "button two"
  * **BONUS:** Accomplish all of the above by binding _only one_ event listener (aka **"Event Delegation"**)
